---------------------------------------------
If we have time (Add ons)

+3b. More robust user accounts/initial signup forms
	- Org: location
	- Volunteers: location, skills
+3b. Can go into settings and change/update account info
+3c. Orgs can update/change details about a project they’ve posted
+3d. Volunteers can also filter opportunities
	- by date, location, time commitment, skills needed
+3f. Volunteers can remove themselves from project
+3f. Volunteers can view/track the hours/impact of past projects

+    Volunteers can leave feedback on their experience with organizations/projects
+    Orgs can rate/leave feedback for volunteers

---------------------------------------------
Likely out of scope, but interesting to think about how to implement

++3b. Some way to verify if Orgs are legitimate non-profits
	- Allow admins to view and accept or decline Orgs
++3e. When volunteers sign up to a project their application is initially pending
	- Allows Orgs to accept or decline volunteers
++3f. Some sort of achievement/impact visualization that volunteers could share on social media
